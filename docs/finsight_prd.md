# SMB Due Diligence AI Tool - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Title
**DueDiligenceAI**: AI-Powered Financial Analysis Tool for SMB Acquisitions

## 2. Overview / Objective
Build an AI-powered SaaS tool that automates and accelerates financial due diligence for small business acquisitions. The tool leverages Claude API to analyze uploaded financial documents and provide instant insights, red flag detection, and financial health assessments to help buyers make informed acquisition decisions in minutes instead of hours or days.

**Primary Goal**: Reduce financial due diligence time from months to hours while maintaining accuracy and identifying critical risks.

## 3. Target Users

### Primary Personas:
- **Acquisition Entrepreneurs**: Individual buyers seeking to acquire SMBs (1-50 employees, $1M-$10M revenue)
- **Micro Private Equity Firms**: Small PE firms managing $10M-$100M funds targeting SMB acquisitions
- **Solo Buyers/Searchers**: Independent searchers and self-funded buyers evaluating multiple deals

### User Characteristics:
- Financial literacy: Intermediate to advanced
- Deal volume: 5-50 evaluations per year
- Time constraints: High (often nights/weekends)
- Budget: Cost-conscious but value time savings

## 4. User Pain Points

### Current State Problems:
- **Time-intensive**: Manual financial analysis takes 8-20 hours per deal
- **Error-prone**: Easy to miss red flags in spreadsheet analysis
- **Inconsistent**: Different analysts use different frameworks
- **Expensive**: Hiring external consultants costs $5K-$15K per analysis
- **Late discovery**: Critical issues found after LOI, wasting time/money
- **Information overload**: Difficult to synthesize key insights from multiple documents

### Emotional Pain Points:
- Anxiety about missing critical financial red flags
- Frustration with repetitive, manual analysis work
- Decision paralysis from information overload
- Fear of overpaying due to incomplete analysis

## 5. Proposed Solution

An AI-powered web application that:
1. **Ingests** financial documents (PDF, Excel, CSV)
2. **Analyzes** using Claude API with specialized financial prompts
3. **Identifies** red flags, anomalies, and risk factors
4. **Calculates** key financial ratios and metrics
5. **Summarizes** findings in investor-friendly format
6. **Enables** interactive Q&A about the business
7. **Exports** professional deal notes and analysis

## 6. Core Features (MVP - 2 Week Sprint)

### 6.1 Document Upload & Processing
- Drag-and-drop interface for PDF/Excel/CSV files
- Support for P&L, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow statements
- Document type auto-detection
- Basic OCR for scanned PDFs

### 6.2 AI Financial Analysis Engine
- Claude API integration for document analysis
- Automated calculation of 15+ key ratios:
  - Revenue CAGR (3-year)
  - Gross/Net margins
  - Current ratio, Debt-to-equity
  - Customer concentration risk
  - Seasonal revenue patterns

### 6.3 Red Flag Detection
- Revenue anomalies (sudden spikes/drops)
- Expense irregularities
- Cash flow inconsistencies
- High customer concentration (>20% revenue from single customer)
- Unusual related-party transactions

### 6.4 Executive Summary Dashboard
- One-page financial health overview
- Traffic light system (Green/Yellow/Red) for key areas
- Top 5 risks and top 5 strengths
- Investment recommendation (Pass/Caution/Proceed)

### 6.5 Basic Q&A Interface
- Text input for business-specific questions
- Claude-powered responses based on uploaded data
- Common question templates (customer mix, seasonality, growth drivers)

### 6.6 Export Functionality
- PDF export of analysis summary
- Excel template with calculated ratios
- Shareable link for team review

### 6.7 Context-Aware Document Search (Vector Database + RAG)
To improve the accuracy and speed of AI-powered Q&A, the system will include a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) layer backed by a vector database.

Uploaded documents will be split into smaller, meaningful sections and converted into vector embeddings for semantic search.

When a user asks a question, the system will fetch only the most relevant document sections rather than sending entire files to the AI.

This allows for faster responses, lower API usage, and more targeted answers tied directly to source material.

Financial metrics and ratios will still be calculated using a separate, reliable pipeline to ensure accuracy, with RAG used mainly to explain results and provide context.

This approach combines the speed and context of semantic search with the consistency and trustworthiness of deterministic calculations, ensuring that both numbers and explanations are accurate and grounded in evidence.
